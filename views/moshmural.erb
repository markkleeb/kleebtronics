<h3>Conceptualization</h3>
<img src = "/img/moshmural-ps.jpg" width="600" />
The idea for the Mosh Mural came from watching crowds at performance venues. While watching the musicians, audience members seldom danced or moved very much to the music. We set out to encourage crowd participation in the venue using responsive visuals.

<h3>Design</h3>
<img src = "/img/moshmural-2d.jpg" width="600" />
Using an XBox Kinect, we were able to determine the positions of individual members of the audience. We were also able to determine the shape of their bodies. Using this data, we designed a visual show in <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/" target="_blank">openFrameworks</a> using the OpenCV library.
