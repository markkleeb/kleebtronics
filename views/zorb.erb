zOrb is a wireless, programmable media controller designed to enhance the performance of musicians and visual artists.
</p>

<h3>Conceptualization</h3>
<p>
<img src = "/img/moshmural-ps.jpg" width="600" />
Digital musicians frequently rely on laptops to control many parts of their performances. We set out to design a device that could be used to remotely control parameters in a program without having to rely on a laptop.

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>

Using an XBox Kinect, we were able to determine the positions of individual members of the audience. We were also able to determine the shape of their bodies. Using this data, we designed a visual show in <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/" target="_blank">openFrameworks</a> using the OpenCV library.

Inside each shape, we drew a few hundred swimming "boids." We used <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/">Craig Reynold's steering behaviors</a> to make them flock together and stay inside the shape.

<h3>Demonstration</h3>

The Mosh Mural has been installed in various music venues, including Public Assembly, Cameo Gallery, Death By Audio, and Secret Project Robot. It was eventually modified to respond to music, as well as movement. The current version of the code has two separate visual modes.
